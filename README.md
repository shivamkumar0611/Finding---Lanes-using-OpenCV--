# Finding---Lanes-using-OpenCV--
Identifying lanes of the road is very common task that human driver performs. This is important to keep the vehicle in the constraints of the lane. This is also very critical task for an autonomous vehicle to perform. And very simple Lane Detection pipeline is possible with simple Computer Vision techniques. This article will describe simple pipeline that can be used for simple lane detection using Python and OpenCV. This exercise is done as part of “Udacity Self driving Car nanodegree”.
